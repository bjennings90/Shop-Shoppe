Using an existing MERN-stack application from a lesson at Rice University, the focus was on using State to refactor code. The functionality that's built into this React app to create state and the means to update state outside of the React component-architecture is in a global state object. Tools used will be Apollo to work with the GraphQL API server and maintain local state such as form inputs to their respective components, but the important data that provides the real content for the site will be managed globally.

# To run App
